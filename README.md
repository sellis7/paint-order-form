# "Pete's Paint"

*A very simply styled, dynamic order form application – completed using NetBeans IDE*

##### General instructions–

Based on numeric values provided, the square footage will be calculated in addition to rounding up  
to how much paint will be needed with a determination of labor hours.

The user can then hit "Summarize Details" which will reveal these calculations, plus a second set  
of values based on different types and quality of product to be chosen. Once the newly-provided form  
is completed, the user is taken to a summary page that details the "order" with the final job details.

All information is only stored as long as the current session is active. No database is used.
